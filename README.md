# SVG-Logo-Maker

This weeks challenge was to create this command-line application allows the user to generate logos in SVG format based on user input. It provides an interactive prompt that guides you through the logo creation process, allowing you to customize the text, text color, shape, and shape color, and generates within a live server. 

I learned quite a bit from this project, and faced alot of challenges regarding the Jest testing, but was able to expand my Inquirer skills to successfully generate any given logo.
